# pyminecraft

A library for communicating with Minecraft clients and servers written in
Python.

## Trying it out

Run this in the top directory:

    python -m example.wrapper.main

This will start a wrapper on port 25564 that you can connect to by entering
`localhost:25564` as the server after selecting "Multiplayer" in the client.

The wrapper expects a Minecraft server to already be running locally on port
25565.
